#  Crates Challenge App
This challenges you to implement concepts around Core Data. You will build an app that
allows someone to buy mystery pallets of goods. When merchandise gets returned, they often
get re-sold as bulk packages/ truck pallets, or even mystery boxes. 

See here for an example: https://bstock.com/auctions/amazon/

The crate must contain:
- Number of items
- Price
- Items (not shown to user until purchased)
- Category
- Number of items

The buyer, will then purchase the items, and be able to see the contents.
